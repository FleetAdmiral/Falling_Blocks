How to play:
Convert the Makefile.linux to Makefile and then compile if on linux.
Use s and f to move the turret up and down, vertically.
Use mouse (keep it at half of the screen for best performance) to aim the turret.
Use spacebar to shoot.
Use alt +left/right and shift + left/right to move the green and red baskets.
respectively (had to use shift instead of control because control + left/right
is a shortcut on mac).
Points will be displayed on the terminal in real time.
